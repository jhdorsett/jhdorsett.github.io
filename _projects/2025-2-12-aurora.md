A few months ago, there was a beautiful aurora borealis that swept down through much of the continental United States. I was blasted with dozens of social media posts of a breathtaking electromagnetic storm sweeping overhead. Here in Vermont, apparently it was pretty nice! People saw it as far south as Indiana. But I had no clue it was happening and I missed it.

I vowed never again. I did a very cursory search for space weather apps on the App Store. There were a variety of nice options, but it looked like they started at $2.99/month. I scoffed. NOAA is publically funded, I think I am entitled to access that data free-of-charge, thank you very much. But what is the data?

NOAA's forecasting uses the OVATION Prime model (Newell et al., 2010) developed at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. This model uses data from this bad boy:

The DMSP satellites are equipped with sensors that measure solar wind. OVATION Prime uses solar wind data, interplanetary magnetic field data, and ultraviolet imaging data from another satellite, TIMED. For each of the four different types of auroras, the authors generate a unique linear regression as a predictive measure for auroral power as a function of solar wind, IMF data, and UV intensity.

And what's really nice is they put up their results online every 30 minutes as new data streams in. So instead of spending money on an app (although apparently I didn't look very hard, there are plenty of ad-supported space weather apps), I decided to recreate their model results and set up notifications in case of an aurora brewing in my area.

The below plot is a direct output from the OVATION model, with some minimal smoothing added. The model outputs estimated Kp (talk about that later) on a 1 degree by 1 degree grid across the planet.

I perform a Gaussian smoothing with the data nearby to calculate the weighted average Kp at my home. Thanks to Github actions, I can automatically pull the new model results and estimate the probability of an aurora at my location. If I wanted to get fancier, I could keep track of the probability and do some time series analysis. I don't think that's really necessary right now.

I ended up catching an aurora about a month after the first one. Here's a photo of that. Beautiful.

Well.

It turns out iPhone night mode does a lot of the heavy lifting in drawing out barely perceptible colors.

Either way, we've got the map.
