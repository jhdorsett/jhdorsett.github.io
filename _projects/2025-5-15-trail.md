I'm Hot Feet, AT Class of 2023. I recently celebrated the two-year anniversary of my start date, and it’s got me reminiscing hard. I’ve been looking back at old photos, thinking about the good times with friends, the hard times with ascents, and the gentler times with my knees.

On my hike, I experienced just about all the clichés the trail has to offer, and one in particular has been on my mind: the Virginia Blues. Objectively, Virginia is long. Of the 13 states the AT crosses, Virginia covers about a quarter of the entire trail. It’s a psychologically challenging stretch for a lot of hikers. After the early rush of adventure—crossing through Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee—we hit Virginia and... stayed there. 

For over a month. Just Virginia. 

During this long slough, I began to wonder: why did it feel like we were making so little progress? Yes, there are mile markers. But sometimes I could swear I'd pass three of the 100 mile markers in a week, and other times it'd take me a month to pass one. A huge part of perceived progress is psychological. And there are a ton of different factors that influence that. With a background in earth science and a passable knowledge of mapping projections, I wanted to perform a rigorous analysis determining how much the maps could be misleading us hikers. And as it turns out, it's significant.

## Maps: an Imperfect Representation

Before we get into the specifics, we require a quick primer on maps. The Earth is a 3D nearly-spherical planet, and maps of it are 2D and generally rectangular. When transforming geographic features from a globe to a sheet, compromises have to be made. Every map has to make a compromise between preserving features shape or their size and there are different mathematical transformations, called map projections, that preserve relevant features for specific use-cases. For essentially all online and digital mapping, the standard is Web Mercator, which preserves shape and distorts size, impacting the distance between features substantially. 

This sketch conceptually demonstrates how the Mercator projection is created, first wrap your blank map into a cylinder around the globe. Then imagine a light source at the center of the Earth projecting the "shadows" of the continents onto the cylinder, which is then unfurled to give our final map. Features near the equator aren't warped much, since the cylinder is very close to the globe, but in polar regions like Russia or Antarctica, the distance between the two allows the "shadow" to become very distorted, changing the shape.

The classic example is the apparent vastness of Greenland. [TheTrueSize.com](https://thetruesize.com) is a great tool that allows you to interrogate the distortions from the Mercator projection on a global scale. I've used it to record this animation. Since accurate navigation hinges on accurate directions, Mercator has historically been used for seafaring applications, and is still the standard for both car navigation apps like Google Maps and hiking apps like AllTrails and FarOut. Mercator preserves directionality on a local scale: anywhere in the world, if two roads meet at a right angle, Mercator will show it as a right angle. 

Typically, distortions in size associated with the Mercator projection are at a much larger scale than people are working with. We either use alternative maps for navigation, like great circles on globes for airline travel, or we don't notice the impact because the journey isn't much work, like in a cross country road trip. Long distance hiking exists at the overlap in that venn diagram: the journey is on a large enough scale that map distortions have an impact **and** hikers travel slow enough that they feel it.

## Enter: The Coast to Coast Trail

<img src="/assets/images/trail/coast2coast_map_both.png" width="300" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

To explore this effect, I invented a trail. An awful one.

The Coast to Coast Trail starts on a beach in Jalisco, Mexico and goes due north—no switchbacks, no scenic detours—just a straight shot to Nunavut, Canada. Nearly 3,500 miles marching due north. See a bridge half a mile west? Don't care, you're swimming. Coming up to a cliff? Hope you brought your climbing gear. 

Imagine I've given you my painstakingly created map and you're attempting the world's first completion of the Coast to Coast Trail, hiking northbound. You've made it to Colorado and take a well deserved zero in Denver. You've spent a few months on this trail and have realized I'm awful at designing trails. Rather than spend the rest of the year completing it, you want to leave your mark--a big sign at the halfway point--and then come home to scold me for sending you on that journey. So you pull up your map, grab a ruler, and measure out the halfway point. You're devastated. It's over 600 miles away across the border, in southern Saskatchewan. It's been months and you're barely a third of the way done.

Weeks pass. Your legs ache. Resentment for the Coast To Coast Trail grows. You make it to a little town in southern Montana and pull into a motel. You spot a dusty old globe sitting in the lobby and trace the trail on the globe and realize it--you're already way past the halfway point. It was in Wyoming! You pack up your bags and go home. 

On this map, the red triangle represents the apparent halfway point based on the map's appearance and the yellow circle represents the real halfway point. The difference between the two is nearly 400 miles. The psychological interpretation of that is clear: if you're going off the map, you'll feel like you're lagging behind. For the Coast to Coast Trail, you'll feel like you're about a month behind where you think you should be. Your sense of progress can take a massive hit.

## On The Appalachian Trail

The Coast to Coast Trail is designed to maximize this effect, spanning 20 degrees in latitude. The Appalachian Trail isn't quite as extreme, but the same distortion shows up. When you're deep in Virginia—pushing big miles and crossing endless ridgelines—it can feel like you're going nowhere. The map isn't showing your progress the way your body feels it. Luckily, we have plenty of symbolic markers to strive for, not just points on a map. 

Getting out of Virginia and making it to Harper's Ferry is the unofficial halfway point. Getting that photo at the ATC feels monumental. But the actual halfway point? It’s still 70 trail miles north in Pennsylvania. 70 miles isn't much, but due to map distortion, it looks like even more. The real halfway point appears nearly 110 miles away from Harpers Ferry on a digital map. That’s an extra 40 miles of perceived distance—not in your legs, but in your brain. Another few days of “not quite there yet,” even when you are.

I calculated these predictions by writing [some Python code (source)](/assets/src/trailmap/main.ipynb) to compute the distance along the trail in real distance and in projected distance for a given map projection. While it's pretty easy to understand for the Coast to Coast Trail, the complex paths of real trails snaking around make the results a little less intuitive.

<div style="clear: both;"></div> 


The difference between the two is about 40 miles, an order of magnitude less than on the Coast to Coast Trail. And in the context of the entire AT, that isn't extreme. But looking at the satellite imagery, it isn't nothing. The true halfway point and the apparent halfway point are in entirely different mountain ranges! If you've hiked this section of PA, you may remember seeing a plaque just before you descend into Boiling Springs, PA. 

<img src="/assets/images/trail/blue_ridge.png" height="400" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

This plaque marks the northernmost extent of the Blue Ridge Mountains. From that point, you want down into the Cumberland Valley and then up into the Allegheny Mountains where the apparent halfway point is. 40 miles may not seem like much, but when you eyeball your progress on a map, you may be off by an entire mountain range!

## Northbound vs. Southbound

But here’s where it gets interesting. I've chosen the halfway point as a single reference to measure the map distortion, but there's always some error in your position unless you're at one of the ends, since there's absolutely zero confusion about where you are on the trail. Intuitively, it makes sense that we accumulate error as we walk and eventually have to make it up somewhere. It turns out that north of the halfway point, map distortion works in the opposite direction. As you head further north, the map starts to compress those miles, and you’ll actually cover ground faster than it appears. This makes sense looking at the halfway point on the Coast to Coast Trail: it looks like there's a good 60% of the trail left, but it's actually only 50%. 

So while you may have felt like you were lagging behind in Virginia, the map now starts showing you more progress. For NoBo hikers, the perception of progress catches up with your actual progress, it feels like you're hiking a little bit further every day than you are.

But for SoBo hikers, the opposite happens. The map actually overestimates your progress for the first half. You're still getting your trail legs but the map is working with you. In the second half of the trail, you're probably crushing marathon days but the map is underestimating your progress, making those 150 mile weeks look more like 140.

## Triple Crown Comparison

Here’s how the distortion looks on the other two Triple Crown trails:

**Pacific Crest Trail:**

<img src="/assets/images/trail/pct_sat.png" height="400" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">


<div style="clear: both;"></div> 

On the PCT, the true halfway point is just to the west of Lake Almanor. The apparent halfway point is over 50 miles ahead, between Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen. 

**Continental Divide Trail:**

## So What’s the Real Difference?

All of the real trails have a discrepancy on the order of at least a few days hike. While this isn't extreme, it is consistent and systematic and visible even in the context of the entire United States. For longer thru-hikes that span greater latitudes like the Great Divide Trail and International Appalachian Trail, the discrepancies grow proportionally. 

Still, it matters.

- On the AT, the halfway point is off by about 35 miles.
- On the CDT, it’s 55.
- On the PCT, a little over 40 miles.

Thru-hiking is built on milestones. We count every mile. We celebrate round numbers. We plan resupplies, zeroes, and big pushes around our mental maps. When that map quietly distorts your progress, it chips away at morale. And these distortions exist in most digital maps of the trail. 

And when you're deep in the long green tunnel of Virginia—or the dusty switchbacks of Northern California, or the endless ridges of Colorado—that small psychological edge might be the thing that keeps you moving. Or doesn’t.

A 40-mile gap on a 2,200-mile hike isn’t going to strand you in the woods—but it can quietly mess with your head. When your GPS dot barely budges across Virginia ridges, even a small visual lag can chip away at your morale. After all, the AT is as much a journey of the mind as it is of the body. A small tweak in how you read a map can be the difference between feeling stuck and remembering that every step is real progress—no matter what the screen says.
Happy trails—and may your miles always feel just a little closer than they look.
