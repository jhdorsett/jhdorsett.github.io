## Welcome

Iâ€™m a scientist and programmer with an MS in Geophysics from Indiana University. My career has been shaped by a deep respect for the natural world and a passion for solving complex problems. In my academic work, I have focused on understanding deformation along the Pacific-North American plate boundary using numerical models to inform seismic hazards. After my MS, I worked as a geophysicist in the oil and gas industry focusing on deepwater exploration in the Guyana-Suriname basin before taking a career break to hike the Appalachian Trail. Since then, I have been working as a research scientist focusing on crustal dynamics and seismic hazards. I have developed a variety of open source modeling packages in Python including:

- BForStrain, which creates strain rate maps from geodetic observations
- SliDeFS, which computes slip deficit rates along faults
- PyDisloc3D, a Python native implementation of the Okada dislocation code 
- PyViscoProp, a Python native implementation of viscoelastic propagator matrix solutions

Broadly, my interests include numerical modeling, crustal deformation, data science, and applications in the renewable sector. Please reach out to my email or LinkedIn if you would like to connect.
