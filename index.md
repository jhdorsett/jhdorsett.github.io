## Building Tools that Bridge Geoscience, Software, and Sustainability

<img src="/assets/images/view_of_katahdin.jpg" alt="Your Photo" height="300" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;">


I’m a scientist and programmer with an MS in Geophysics from Indiana University. My career has been shaped by a deep respect for the natural world and a passion for solving complex problems. In my academic work, I have focused on understanding deformation along the Pacific-North American plate boundary using numerical models to inform seismic hazards. After my MS, I worked in the oil and gas industry focusing on deepwater exploration in the Guyana-Suriname basin before taking a career break to hike the Appalachian Trail. 

That journey refocused my career to work in projects that align with my values: sustainability, curiosity, and a committment to scientific communication. Now, I’m applying my technical background in coding, data science, and problem-solving to projects that span science and technology with alignment with my values. This site showcases research projects, purpose-built tools, and some educational posts that reflect this focus.

I am always interested in collaborating on new projects. Please reach out if you are interested in any of the work I've shared here.

Here's a random project from my site. I hope you enjoy it!
